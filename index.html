<p>I am currently learning to code with Code First Girls. Going over everything from how the
internet works, to creating websites and version control with git. A lot to cover in only 8 weeks!
Everyone should learn to code, here are some pretty good reasons why... </p>

<ol>
<li> HTML is cool </li>
<li> JSS is the best </li>
<li> CSS is cooler </li>
</ol>

<p>What do you need to create a website?</p>

<li> Not much!</li>
<li> A computer (always a good start) </li>
<li> A text editor (I am using atom) </li>
<li> A web browser (I am using chrome) </li>
<li> Some HTML, CSS and JS files </li>

<p>Follow my progress on github </p>
